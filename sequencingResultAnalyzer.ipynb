Simply copy paste the optained results from directly below and (optionally) provide the sequence of your gene that was cloned into the plasmid to check for potentional errors. In case you cloned a RNAi plasmid, you have to indicate this in the sequence from the 20/32 primer by adding \"rnai\" to the sequence in any place (see below). \n",

Since I am too lazy to implement this myself, an implementation by NameNeedle is used. This package has to be installed by the google server first which is why the run will take probably like 10 seconds. May you fogive me. \n"
